CS 466 Mini Class Project
-------------------------

This project implements a motif finding algorithm modeled after the Gibbs algorithm. This was completed as part of CS 466: BioInformatics
at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. 

Benchmark
-------------------------
This Python class generates motifs and plants them randomly into generated DNA sequences.

GIBBS
-------------------------
This CPP class runs a modified Gibbs algorithm on the generated data. The results file
shows the predicted location of the planted motif.

Analysis
-------------------------
This Python class compares the predictions made by gibbs.cpp to the actual locations of the
planted motifs. The output shows the performance.
